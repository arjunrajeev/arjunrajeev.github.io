It has been a long time that I have been thinking about creating a blog spot, but where to start. I thought about wordpress and other possible options and finally gave up. Recently I started working on github pages _(by accident)_ and then came across jekyll. I was always fascinated about markdowns and jekyll just took me by surprise. I am able to create static web pages simply by typing flavoured markdown and boom my html is ready. 

I am greatful to jekyll for providing me with this platform and of course github for the github pages, I see myself becoming an active blogger. So I thought why not start blogging about the awesomeness of jekyll. John Gruber and Aaron Swartz created markdowns in early 2004 to enable dummies like me to create html pages at ease and see where it had lead us today. I can write extensive web pages to even highlighted code based on the programming language of my choice. I can provide a very presentable concept rather wothout creating a lot of mess. 

Check out the [Jekyll docs][jekyll-docs] for more info on how to get the most out of Jekyll. If you have questions, you can ask them on [Jekyll Talk][jekyll-talk].
